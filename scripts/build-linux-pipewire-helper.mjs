// Builds the Linux cursor/capture helper (electron/native/pipewire-capture) and
// vendors it to electron/native/bin/linux-<arch>/, the folder
// pipeWireCursorRecordingSession.ts resolves at runtime.
//
// The Linux counterpart of build-macos-screencapturekit-helper.mjs and
// build-windows-wgc-helper.mjs.
//
// PIPEWIRE needs no pkg-config and no dev package: the C shim compiles against
// headers vendored in the repo and resolves libpipewire with dlopen at runtime.
// That is the point — libpipewire-0.3-dev is not installed on a stock Ubuntu,
// and requiring it would gate the whole Linux build on a package the base
// system does not ship.
//
// FFMPEG is different, and has been since the helper started encoding H.264.
// It is linked normally, its libraries are staged next to the binary by
// stageFfmpeg() below, and the RUNPATH points at them. Unlike the compositor
// addon there is no symbol renaming: the helper is a separate PROCESS, so
// Chromium's libffmpeg.so is never in its address space and cannot collide.
// See its Cargo.toml.
//
// The crate is NOT part of the crates/ workspace (see its Cargo.toml for why),
// so it is built by pointing cargo at its own manifest.

/**
 * Copies the vendored ffmpeg shared libraries into `<dir>/helper-ffmpeg/`.
 *
 * THE SUBDIRECTORY IS THE WHOLE POINT. `electron/native/bin/linux-x64/` already
 * holds libavcodec.so.62 and friends — but those are the copies whose every
 * symbol was renamed to `osff_*` by scripts/build-linux-compositor-addon.mjs,
 * so that the compositor addon does not bind to Chromium's own ffmpeg once
 * Electron dlopens it. Two different builds of the same soname, needed by two
 * different consumers, and only one of them can win a directory.
 *
 * The addon needs the renamed set next to itself; the helper needs the ordinary
 * set. So the helper's RUNPATH is `$ORIGIN/helper-ffmpeg` (see build.rs) and its
 * libraries live here. Putting them side by side produced exactly one symptom,
 * which the probe below catches:
 *
 *   undefined symbol: avcodec_send_frame, version LIBAVCODEC_62
 *
 * AND THE NAME IS PART OF IT. This was `<dir>/ffmpeg/` until a third claimant
 * turned up on the same path: fetch-ffmpeg.mjs vendors the static ffmpeg
 * EXECUTABLE to `<dir>/ffmpeg` (PINNED["linux-x64"].exe), and audioPeaks.ts
 * resolves that same path expecting a binary. Whoever ran last won, and the
 * loser failed obliquely — `EEXIST: mkdir .../ffmpeg` here, or `spawn …
 * EACCES` from audioPeaks when it found a directory where a binary belonged.
 * Two artifacts of different shapes cannot share a name; this one moved because
 * a bare `ffmpeg` means the executable to every other reader of this tree.
