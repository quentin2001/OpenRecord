//
// `compositor_view.node` is an untracked build artifact, and plain `npm run build` does NOT rebuild
// it (only `build:win` runs `build:native:compositor`). So a bare `npm run build` — or a fresh
// worktree that inherited a copy from the main checkout — happily ships a `.node` built from
// whatever the sources looked like days ago.
//
// That failure is silent, which is what makes it worth a hard error. Scene fields the app sends are
// `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side, so an addon predating a contract change does not reject the
// payload: it ignores the unknown key, takes the default, and falls back to older art. The feature
// simply does nothing, with no error in any log — it reads exactly like a bug in the TypeScript, and
// it has already cost one full false-trail investigation (custom cursor themes, 2026-07-27, where
// the shipped addon was 3 days older than the commit adding `cursorSprites`).
//
// ponytail: mtime comparison, not content hashing. A `git checkout` restamps source mtimes, so this
// can fire when the addon is actually fine. That trade is deliberate — the false positive costs one
// rebuild, the false negative ships a broken installer. Switch to hashing the sources into a stamp
// file next to the `.node` if branch-switching makes the noise annoying.

 * it), and the same failure that hook could not see: the linker binds each symbol to
 * the newest version the BUILD machine
 * offers, so the runner image silently decides the oldest distro the packages run on.
 * It works on every developer machine and in CI by construction, and only the target
 * distro tells the truth.
 *
 * Nothing in the source asks for any of it. Built on ubuntu-latest (24.04) the payload
 * needed GLIBC_2.38 for four `__isoc23_strto*` — glibc 2.38's C23 redirect of `strtol`
 * — GLIBCXX_3.4.32 for `_ZSt21ios_base_library_initv`, which GCC 13.2+ emits into every
 * translation unit that includes <iostream>, and GLIBC_2.35 for one `hypotf`, a symbol
 * that has existed since 2.2.5 and whose newest version Rust's f32::hypot simply took.
 *
 * That shipped: on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12 and RHEL 9, whisper-stt-server and the ggml
 * backends died in ld.so before main() (transcription and captions fail with a developer
 * error), and on RHEL 9 compositor_view.node failed require() as well (no preview, and
 * every export falls back to the no-op compositor). The app still LAUNCHES on all of
 * them — Electron itself only needs 2.25 — so it reads as a broken app rather than a
 * broken package, and nothing in any log says otherwise. No package format catches it
 * either: the deb/rpm/pacman `depends` lists are hand-written in electron-builder.json5,
 * and electron-builder passes fpm none of --rpm-autoreq*, so not even dnf generates the
 * `libc.so.6(GLIBC_2.38)` requirement that would have refused the install.
 *
 * The ceiling is what the OLDEST distro the README claims actually provides. Ubuntu
 * 22.04 is the binding one — glibc 2.35, libstdc++6 from GCC 12 — against Debian 12's
 * 2.36 with the same libstdc++. Raising any of these is a decision to drop a distro
 * from the README, not a build detail; the runners are pinned to match (build.yml's
