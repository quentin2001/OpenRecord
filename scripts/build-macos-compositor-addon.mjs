// Builds the native Metal/VideoToolbox compositor addon (crates/compositor-view-napi)
// and vendors it to electron/native/compositor-view/build/compositor_view.node — the
// path compositorViewService.ts's candidate list resolves at runtime.
//
// The macOS twin of build-windows-compositor-addon.mjs. Where that one has to sweep
// for vcvarsall to put MSVC on PATH, this one only needs the Xcode command-line tools
// (`xcrun` finds the SDK and libclang for bindgen, see crates/compositor/build.rs).
//
// FFMPEG — the one thing that is NOT symmetric. On Windows, scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs
// vendors BtbN's pinned "-lgpl-shared" build into crates/thirdparty/. BtbN publishes
// no macOS target (that script exits 1 on darwin, by design), so there is no
// equivalent download and the tree has to be built locally. `--print-ffmpeg-recipe`
// prints the exact configure line; the LGPL posture is the part that matters and is
// not negotiable:
//
//   * NO --enable-gpl and NO --enable-nonfree. ffmpeg is LGPL by default and becomes
//     GPL the moment either is passed (x264/x265 come in with --enable-gpl), which
//     would relicense this MIT app. Same rule fetch-ffmpeg.mjs enforces on Windows
//     with `ffmpeg -L`.
//   * --enable-shared: the addon dynamically links libavcodec/libavformat/… .
//
// A Homebrew ffmpeg will NOT do as a drop-in: brew's formula builds with
// --enable-gpl. It is fine to develop against, never fine to ship.

 * one of those pages is killed outright:
 *
 *     signal: SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)
 *     termination: { namespace: "CODESIGNING", indicator: "Invalid Page" }
 *
 * No JS error, no stack — the app just dies at `require()`. It only bites on the
 * SECOND build onwards, which is what makes it so confusing: the addon works, you
 * change one line of Rust, and now nothing loads.
 *
 * Writing to a temp name in the same directory and renaming gives the new content a

/**
 * Vendors the ffmpeg dylibs next to the addon and rewrites every install name to
 * `@rpath`, so the packaged app loads its own copies instead of a build-machine path.
 *
 * Straight out of `cargo`, the `.node` references its dependencies by ABSOLUTE path
 * (`otool -L` shows `/Users/…/crates/thirdparty/…/libavcodec.62.dylib`). That works on
 * the machine that built it and nowhere else — the installed app would fail at
 * `require()` with a dyld error naming a directory the user has never had. Windows does
 * not hit this because `LoadLibrary` searches `PATH`, which is what
 * `ensureFfmpegSharedDllsOnPath()` prepends; macOS has no such search, so the fix has to
 * be baked into the binary.
 *
 * Three edits per artefact:
 *   - each dylib's own id becomes `@rpath/<name>`;
 *   - every inter-library reference (libavcodec -> libavutil, and so on) is rewritten;
 *   - the addon gains `@loader_path` as an rpath, so `@rpath/libavutil.60.dylib`
 *     resolves next to `compositor_view.node` — which is exactly where electron-builder
 *     puts them via the mac `extraResources` filter `darwin-*​/*`.
 *
 * Re-signing is required and not optional: `install_name_tool` invalidates the existing
 * ad-hoc signature, and macOS kills a process that faults a page of a binary whose
 * signature no longer matches (the same `SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)` documented on
 * `installAtomically` above).
