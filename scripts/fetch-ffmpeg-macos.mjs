// The macOS counterpart of scripts/fetch-ffmpeg.mjs, and it BUILDS rather than downloads
// — not by preference. BtbN, whose pinned "-lgpl-shared" archives that script fetches for
// Windows, publishes no macOS target. The macOS binaries that do circulate (evermeet,
// osxexperts, Homebrew) are all GPL: they ship x264/x265, which `--enable-gpl` pulls in.
// Linking any of them would relicense this MIT app under the GPL, so none of them is a
// candidate however convenient.
//
// The build is therefore from source, from the pinned release tarball, checksummed, with
// neither --enable-gpl nor --enable-nonfree — and the result is verified by asking the
// binary itself (`ffmpeg -L`) rather than by trusting the configure line. That last step
// is the one that matters: it is the same check fetch-ffmpeg.mjs performs on Windows, and
// it is what catches a tree that was replaced by hand with a GPL one.
//
// Roughly five minutes on an M-series. Idempotent: an existing tree that passes the
// licence check is left alone.

 * Where the pinned tarball can be fetched, in order of preference.
 *
 * ffmpeg.org is canonical and stays first, but it cannot be the only one:
 * GitHub's `macos-15-intel` runner pool cannot reach it. On the v1.8.0-rc.6
 * build the x64 leg died twice, twenty minutes apart, on
 * `curl: (35) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer` about a second after
 * starting — while the arm64 leg on `macos-latest` fetched the same tarball
 * from the same host in the same runs and succeeded both times. An immediate
 * reset that reproduces on one runner pool and never on the other is an
 * egress-level block, not congestion, so retrying alone does not clear it.
 *
 * Debian's `.orig.tar.xz` is the upstream tarball unmodified — verified
 * byte-identical to TARBALL_SHA256 below — and deb.debian.org is CDN-backed.
 * It is a fallback, not a replacement: the checksum is what makes trusting a
 * second origin safe, and it gates every source equally.
 *
 * When the pin moves, a mirror may not carry the new version yet. That is not
 * a failure mode to design around — the list is tried in order and a source
 * that 404s falls through to the next, with every attempt reported if none
 * works. (`--retry-all-errors` does not except a 404, so a missing mirror costs
 * its retries — a few seconds, once per pin bump. Narrowing that would mean
 * giving up the retry on connection resets, which is the whole point.)
