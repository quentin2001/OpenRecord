// Stages vcomp140.dll beside the whisper/ggml payload it is loaded by.
//
// ggml-base.dll and ggml-cpu.dll are compiled with OpenMP, so they import
// vcomp140.dll — Microsoft's OpenMP runtime, which ships with the Visual C++
// Redistributable and is NOT part of Windows. Every machine that can build this
// repo has it in System32, so the dependency is invisible here and in CI, and on
// a clean machine whisper-stt-server dies in the loader before main(): captions
// and transcription fail with the unactionable timeout described in
// scripts/before-pack.cjs.
//
// This is the same class of failure that Store certification rejected 1.9.1 for,
// and it survived that fix because the guard only looked for msvcp/vcruntime/concrt
// prefixes — `vcomp` matches none of them. The guard now covers the whole family
// and, more usefully, only objects when the DLL is not shipped alongside.
//
// Shipping the DLL rather than rebuilding whisper without OpenMP is deliberate:
// it leaves the computation byte-for-byte identical, where -DGGML_OPENMP=OFF would
// swap OpenMP's scheduler for ggml's own and change transcription throughput by an
// amount nobody has measured. 200 KB against that unknown is a cheap trade. If the
// dependency ever becomes inconvenient, measure first, then switch.

 * Every vcomp140.dll under a Visual Studio redistributable directory.
 *
 * The toolset tag moves with the compiler — Microsoft.VC143.OpenMP on the 2022
 * runners, Microsoft.VC145.OpenMP on a 2026 install — so this globs rather than
 * hard-coding it, and takes the newest it finds. The redistributable copy is used
 * in preference to the one in System32 because that is the copy Microsoft licenses
 * for redistribution with an application.
 *
 * Discovery reuses `findVcVarsAll`, the same lookup the two native build scripts
 * already run, so a Visual Studio installed anywhere is found here as well: it
 * consults VCVARSALL, then vswhere, then VSINSTALLDIR, then sweeps for the
 * pre-release channels vswhere does not enumerate. vcvarsall.bat sits at
 * `<root>\VC\Auxiliary\Build\`, hence the three levels up.
 *
 * That root is searched alone when it yields anything, which both prefers the
 * toolchain that actually compiled the helpers and avoids re-walking the same
 * subtree — the installation usually lives under the fixed paths below, and those
 * trees are large enough that scanning one twice is worth avoiding.
