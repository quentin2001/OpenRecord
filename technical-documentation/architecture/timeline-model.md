# Timeline coordinate model — clip-anchored modifiers

A modifier (zoom, speed, annotation, full-camera) in the project document is **anchored
to a clip in that clip's own source time**, not to an absolute timeline position. The
single module that knows how the three coordinate frames relate —
[`src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.ts) —
is the only place that translates between them. Every consumer — the timeline UI, the
native preview, the export, the agent LLM, the captions layer — reads the modifier
through that module and never mixes the frames by hand. The v4→v5 migration that
introduced the clip anchor is documented in
[document-model.md](document-model.md); this file is about the model in force and the
contract of `timelineMap`.

## Two time reference frames

The document carries three coordinate systems. A raw clip is identity between
source-time and raw-virtual-time (no speed is baked into its geometry), so within a
clip raw↔source is a plain shift by the clip's own start offset. The interesting
boundary is between the **RAW** ruler and the **COMPRESSED** playback sequence:

| Frame | Definition | Who works in it |
|---|---|---|
| **RAW virtual** (`currentTimeSec`, the ruler, the playhead, `document.timeline.clips[].timelineStartSec`/`timelineEndSec`) | The ruler the user manipulates. **Trims still occupy their space.** Region authoring, clip drag/resize/reorder, and the timeline ruler all happen here. | `NewEditorShell` (transport, seek), `V4Timeline` (drag/resize of clips and pills), `useTimeline` (every region mutation), `document.timeline` ops |
| **SOURCE** (a clip's own media time: `assetId` + `sourceStartSec`/`sourceEndSec`) | What the decoders and the native compositor actually advance. Region anchors (`clipId` + `sourceStartSec` + `sourceEndSec`) live here. | `NativeCompositorOverlay`, `useNativePlaybackSync`, `sceneDescription` (→ native preview), `documentExporter` (multi-clip export) |
| **COMPRESSED** (the trim-narrowed `resolvePlaybackSegments` laid out back-to-back from 0) | What the native free-run stream and the export frame counter walk through. Indexed by `clipIndex` into `SceneDescription.clips`. | `buildSceneDescription` (`sceneDescription.ts`), the native compositor's `clip_index` field, `exportMultiNative` |

The model splits the two so each consumer can read what it cares about without having
to translate. Mixing them desyncs preview from render on zoom and trim: a region
authored against the RAW ruler but projected against the COMPRESSED segment layout
slips by exactly the trimmed duration, fires on the wrong clip, and pairs with the
wrong camera. `timelineMap` is the single line that keeps that line of code from
existing.

## Clip-anchored modifiers

Every region (zoom / speed / annotation / cameraFullscreen) is stored as one or more
**clip-anchored fragments** — `{clipId, sourceStartSec, sourceEndSec, …payload}` — keyed
to the clip it lives on, in that clip's source media time. A region the user drew
across a clip boundary is stored as one fragment per covered clip; the fragments carry
no marker tying them together, but the ruler still renders them as one pill because
they share the same properties (see rule 1 below). Trims narrow a clip's kept source
ranges, so an anchored fragment is hidden/clipped by the same interval math with no
reprojection; reorder carries the fragment with its `clipId`, again with no
reprojection. The schema field `startMs`/`endMs` is a **derived cache** of the
fragment's current RAW ruler span — it is present so that un-migrated consumers and
the agent LLM (which reasons in virtual seconds) keep reading the shape they always
did, but the anchor is the source of truth. A structural op (move/duplicate/trim)
re-derives `startMs`/`endMs` from the anchor; if the cache ever disagrees with the
anchor, the anchor wins.

This is the data-level expression of the authoring-levels diagram in
[overview.md](overview.md#authoring-levels): modifiers are presented above the timeline
in the UX but stored down on the clip in the data.

## The `timelineMap` contract

Every public export of
[`src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.ts).
"Direction" is what flows in vs what flows out.

| Function | What it converts | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| `anchorRawRegionsToClips` (`:51`) | v4 RAW-virtual-ms region → one anchored fragment per covered clip (drops zero-length / off-timeline regions) | RAW-virtual → clip-anchored |
| `anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` (`:376`) | Same as above but never drops user data: emits `{…fragment, startMs, endMs}` for anchored regions and passes un-anchorable regions through with their original ms | RAW-virtual → v5 stored shape |
| `anchoredToRawSpanSec` (`:92`) | One anchored fragment → its current RAW-virtual span on the ruler | clip-anchored → RAW-virtual |
| `regionIdentityKey` (`:163`) | A region → canonical identity key (properties minus position/provenance); equal keys = "same kind, same look" | region → identity string |
| `coalesceByIdentity` (`:193`) | Set of identified spans → merged runs that touch and share an identity | spans → pills |
| `clampSpanAgainstNeighbours` (`:223`) | A desired span clamped against different-identity neighbours (no cascade) | desired → clamped span |
| `coalesceRegionsForRuler` (`:251`) | Region array → ruler pills (one entry per merged run, payload carried by `member`) | regions → pills |
| `resolvePillIds` (`:275`) | Region id → every region id under its pill (recomputed, not stored) | id → ids |
| `dropPillById` / `dropPillsByIds` (`:290` / `:299`) | Delete every region under a pill (resolved from the merge rule) | regions → regions |
| `replacePillSpan` (`:316`) | Move/resize a pill: clamp against different-identity neighbours, then re-anchor to the clamped span | pill + clip layout → re-anchored fragments |
| `segmentRawSpanSec` (`:401`) | One kept playback segment → its RAW-virtual extent | segment → RAW span |
| `projectRegionsToSource` (`:452`) | Region array → source-ms entries with `clipIndex` for native (anchored path uses anchor; unanchored path falls back to RAW mapping through each segment's own raw extent — never drops an un-anchorable region onto an unrelated clip) | RAW/anchored → source + `clipIndex` |
| `resolveNativePosition` (`:556`) | RAW-virtual playhead → `{clip, clipIndex, sourceTimeSec}` for the active native decoder + paired camera (snaps to the next kept segment when the playhead sits over a trimmed-out stretch) | RAW-virtual → source + `clipIndex` |

The two **universal region rules** every region kind obeys are expressed once in this
file rather than re-derived per kind:

1. **Merge** (`coalesceByIdentity`) — two regions of the same kind with the same
   identity that touch are one pill. How they became adjacent (authored side by side,
   split by a reorder then rejoined, …) is irrelevant; identity is what a region *is*,
   not where it came from.
2. **Repel** (`clampSpanAgainstNeighbours`) — two regions of the same kind with
   different identities may not overlap. An edit clamps to the neighbour's edge; the
   neighbour never moves (no cascade).

A kind with no properties (trim, full-camera) collapses to a constant identity, so its
regions always merge — the long-standing trim behaviour, now derived from the general
rule. `clipId` is in `NON_IDENTITY_FIELDS` and must stay there: it says *where* a region
is, never what it is, and a trim ventilated across a clip boundary is necessarily 2+ rows
that have to keep rendering and deleting as ONE pill.

### Trims carry a clip anchor too (v7)

A trim is `{assetId, clipId?, startSec, endSec}` — `startSec`/`endSec` *are* its source
window, so `clipId` was the only field it needed to become a clip-anchored region like
any other. Before v7 it had none, and source time is per **asset**: two clips over the
same media (a duplicated clip) share a coordinate space, so "which clip is this cut on?"
had no answer and each reader invented one. That produced three symptoms from one cause —
the transcript pane showed the cut on both clips, the ruler drew it on the first, and
playback/export removed the span from both.

`trimAppliesToClip`
([`trim-mapping.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/trim-mapping.ts)) is the single
definition of that question; `buildClipSection`, `trimToTimelineSpan` and
`resolvePlaybackSegments` all route through it. A trim with no `clipId` — pre-v7, or the
inter-clip cuts `replaceTimeline` mints, which lie outside every clip by construction —
keeps the historical asset-wide meaning, so old documents render unchanged.

One asymmetry with the other kinds, on purpose: `trimToTimelineSpan` places an **anchored**
trim on any *overlap* with its clip, but an **un-anchored** one only when the clip
*contains* its start. Containment is doing the disambiguation in the un-anchored case;
for an anchored trim it would be a second, stricter test that hides the pill of a cut
`resolvePlaybackSegments` still applies — content removed with nothing on the ruler to
click.

### The same ambiguity at playback time

Storing the anchor settles which clip a cut is *on*; the preview still has to answer,
sixty times a second, which clip is *playing*. It reads the `<video>`'s own source clock,
and a source time is per asset, so the question is the same one — one layer up, against a
moving target. `VirtualPreview` tracks the answer in `activeClipIdRef` and passes it into
`locateSourcePosition` / `locateKeptSegment` / `findNextKeptSegment`
([`virtual-preview.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/virtual-preview.ts)); the rule
those three now share is that **a named clip is believed over anything inferred from
(assetId, sourceTime)**. Three readers had each weakened it in their own way:

- `locateSourcePosition` gave a clip an *exclusive* closing edge unless it was the last
  element of the clips **array**, and the named clip shared that edge. In the last ~50 ms
  of a clip — exactly when the rAF is deciding what to play next — the clip disowned its
  own final frames and the ambiguous scan handed them to a twin over the same recording,
  reporting the playhead near the END of that twin. Playback then saw "clip end reached"
  on a clip nothing follows and stopped, parking the playhead at the end of the timeline.
  Because the exception keyed off array position, whether it happened depended on clip
  ORDER: with a foreign clip laid down last there was no taker, the scan returned null and
  the rAF's timeline-order fallback quietly did the right thing. The closing edge is now
  inclusive for a named clip, and the scan resolves by strict containment first, falling
  back to the closing edge only if nobody claims the time — the same answer for a plain
  single-asset timeline, reached without consulting the order.
- "Am I inside a cut?" scanned every kept segment by asset, so a twin that KEEPS the
  stretch answered for the clip that cuts it and the cut was never skipped during
  playback. `locateKeptSegment` restricts the question to the segments of the clip being
  played: a source time none of them covers is inside *that* clip's trim, however many
  other clips keep it.
- `findNextKeptSegment`'s source-clock fallback (for when the raw ruler lags behind the
  video) compared source positions across a whole asset. "Later in source time" only means
  anything within one clip: with a slice from late in a recording laid down BEFORE a
  trimmed slice from early in it, playing into that cut answered the first clip — raw start
  0 — so playback jumped to the top of the timeline, replayed into the same cut, and
  looped. It is now scoped to the clip being played, and simply does not apply when no clip
  is named (the RAW-ruler test above is already the general answer).

### Cursor telemetry is source time, and belongs to every clip that replays it

Auto-zoom reads recorded cursor movement, which is captured against the ORIGINAL media
file: `timeMs` is the asset's SOURCE time, the same axis `cursor-track.ts` maps through
`locateSourcePosition`. Zoom regions are authored in RAW TIMELINE ms — that is what
`anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` ventilates across clips. The two axes coincide for exactly
one layout: a single clip, starting at 0, covering the whole recording. Feeding the
detector's source-time output straight to the store therefore dropped every suggestion
wherever `[0, assetDuration]` happens to fall on the ruler, i.e. on the first clip —
"automatic zooms only decorate the first clip". `buildAutoZoomSuggestionsForClips`
([`zoom-suggestions.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/zoom-suggestions.ts)) does the
projection: per clip of the asset, a plain shift (a raw clip is identity between source and
raw-virtual time), so a dwell replayed by two clips over one recording yields one zoom on
each. Each clip sees only the samples inside its own source window, so a dwell a cut split
across two clips is no longer one dwell — the cursor did not sit still across the cut on
the timeline the user is watching.

### The same ambiguity in the transcript pane

Two clips over one media do not only share a source coordinate space — they share the
**transcript**, which also belongs to the asset. The pane renders one block per clip, so
the same `AxcutWord` is projected twice and `word.id` names a moment in the media, not a
thing on screen. `ClipWord.id` = `clipWordId(clip.id, word.id)`
([`aggregated-transcript.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/aggregated-transcript.ts))
is the on-screen identity; the React key, `data-word-id`, the cue highlight and the caret
anchor all use it, and `findCueWordId` selects its section by `cue.clipId` before
returning one. The synthetic `[silence]` tokens make the scoping unconditional rather
than a shared-media special case: `withSilenceGaps` numbers them from 1 inside each clip,
so `silence_1` exists in every block regardless of asset.

The caret/selection helpers at the bottom of `RightPanes.tsx` never parse that id — they
read it off `data-word-id` and scope every query to one block's editor element, so they
stay correct whatever the id looks like.

## Invariants

A change that breaks one of these is wrong even if every test passes; treat them as
the contract a reviewer can grade against. Each is asserted in
[`timelineMap.test.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/timelineMap.test.ts).

- **Anchor wins over the cache.** A region with a complete `{clipId, sourceStartSec,
  sourceEndSec}` lands on its source span regardless of what `startMs`/`endMs` say.
  (`projectRegionsToSource`, anchored path — see the "places an anchored region from
  its anchor, ignoring a stale startMs/endMs" test.)
- **RAW ↔ source within one clip is identity.** A region's anchor `[a, b]` on a clip
  whose `sourceStartSec = 0` lands on source `[a, b]`. Speed is not baked into the
  geometry — the clip is a flat re-mapping, never a stretch.
- **A trim is invisible to a region's source moment.** Identity clip `src[0,10]` with a
  trim at `[2,4]`: a region authored at RAW `[6,8]` lands on source `[6,8]`, not
  `[8,10]`. (`resolveNativePosition` / `projectRegionsToSource` "keeps a region on its
  source moment despite a trim before it".)
- **A region fully under a trim is dropped, never leaked.** Two clips of *different*
  assets whose source windows overlap numerically: a zoom fully trimmed away on its
  own clip must not re-appear on the later clip. (`projectRegionsToSource` "drops a
  region a trim removes entirely rather than leaking it onto a later clip".)
- **A named clip beats anything inferred from (assetId, sourceTime), and clip ORDER is
  never an input.** Asserted in
  [`virtual-preview.test.ts`](../../src/lib/ai-edition/timeline/virtual-preview.test.ts)
  rather than `timelineMap.test.ts`: two clips over one recording, at the closing edge of
  the one being played, must resolve to *that* clip — and must do so identically however
  the clips are laid out, including with a foreign clip between or around them. The same
  rule governs "am I inside a cut?" (`locateKeptSegment`) and "what plays next?"
  (`findNextKeptSegment`), whose source-clock fallback may only speak about the clip it was
  given.
- **Same-identity, same-clip stays one pill; different-identity does not merge.** Two
  regions of equal properties that touch → one pill; touch with one property
  changed → two pills, with no memory of ever having been one. (`coalesceByIdentity`
  and `replacePillSpan` "clamps a resize at a neighbouring pill of different
  properties (magnet)".)
- **Repel never cascades.** A different-identity neighbour acts as a wall — the
  edited span stops at its edge and the neighbour never moves. (`clampSpanAgainst
  Neighbours` "stops at a different-identity neighbour on the right" / "left".)
- **Identity ignores provenance.** `id`, `clipId`, `sourceStartSec`, `reason`,
  `origin`, `source`, `annotationSource`, and the legacy `groupId` are *not* part of
  the identity key. Two regions that differ only in any of those still merge when
  adjacent. (`regionIdentityKey` "ignores position and provenance entirely" and the
  regression test "merges two independently authored regions that carry DIFFERENT
  legacy groupIds".)
- **Re-anchoring drops `groupId`.** A v4 import may carry a `groupId`; after a write
  or migration it is gone. (`anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` "drops groupId when
  re-anchoring, so it stops propagating".)
- **`visibleSegments` ordering matches `SceneDescription.clips`.** The `clipIndex`
  emitted by `projectRegionsToSource` / `resolveNativePosition` lines up with the
  native stream because both consume the same array in the same order. Passing a
  different array (e.g. already-sorted segments) to the projection while sending the
  original to the native bridge silently desyncs the mapping.
- **A region that covers no clip is dropped by ventilation** (`anchorRawRegionsToClips`
  / `ventilateSpanAcrossClips`), and `anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` passes it through
  unanchored so the data is not lost. The two layers disagree on purpose — the
  low-level primitive is for explicit projection, the migration wrapper is for
  preserving user data.
- **A region authored on a clip that was later deleted disappears** (anchor resolves
  to null, the fragment is not shown). Its id is preserved in the document so undo
  restores it with its anchor.

## SSOT façades

When the timeline shape changes — a new field on a region, a new region kind, a
change to the anchor contract — every one of these readers/writers must be updated
in the same commit, or the project round-trips into an inconsistent state:

| Consumer | File | What it reads / writes |
|---|---|---|
| **Document layer (ops)** | `src/lib/ai-edition/document/timeline.ts` | Region CRUD; calls `rederiveRegionMs` (cache-only) and `reanchorRegions` (rebuilds identities); routes every mutation through `timelineMap`. |
| **Schema v4→v5 preprocess** | `src/lib/ai-edition/schema/index.ts` (`documentSchema` v4→v5 preprocess, `:555-595`) | Re-anchors `zoomRanges`, `annotations`, `legacyEditor.speedRegions`, `legacyEditor.cameraFullscreenRegions` on every parse. The single disk-load site. |
| **Timeline UI** | `src/components/ai-edition/v4/V4Timeline.tsx` | Reads lanes through `coalesceRegionsForRuler` (`:321, :329, :337, :347`) and `coalescedTrimGroups` (`:363`); pill edit hits the pill resolved by `resolvePillIds` via the store. |
| **Inspector selection pane** | `src/components/ai-edition/v4/FloatingInspector.tsx` (`SelectionPane`, `:444`) | Edits a selected region by pill id; routes through `useTimeline` and therefore through `replacePillSpan`. |
| **Store / authoring (UI)** | `src/lib/ai-edition/store/useTimeline.ts` | Every `add*`, `update*Span`, `removeRegion` goes through `anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` (`:134, :163, :278, :305, :329`) and `replacePillSpan` / `dropPillsByIds` / `resolvePillIds`. |
| **Native preview scene** | `src/native/sceneDescription.ts` (`:489, :508, :517, :531`) | Calls `projectRegionsToSource` for every region kind before serialising to the native compositor. |
| **Native playback sync** | `src/native/useNativePlaybackSync.ts` (`:22, :39`) | Resolves the RAW playhead through `resolveNativePosition` to feed `setActiveClip` / `presentTime`. |
| **Native compositor overlay** | `src/components/ai-edition/NativeCompositorOverlay.tsx` (`:3, :70`) | Same — `resolveNativePosition(currentTimeSec, nativeClips, document.timeline.clips)` — to keep preview in sync with the timeline ruler. |
| **Multi-clip export** | `src/lib/ai-edition/exporter/documentExporter.ts` | Projects regions to source per-clip through `region-ventilation`'s `projectRegionsToSourceTime`; identity single-clip projects are unchanged. |
| **Captions layer** | `src/lib/ai-edition/captions/cues.ts` (`:14-15` and `captionCuesToTextRegions`) | Caption cues are a derived view of the transcript; the projection to source at export goes through `projectRegionsToSourceTime` from `region-ventilation`, matching the multi-clip export path so preview and file agree. |
| **Agent LLM tools** | `electron/ai-edition/agent-tools.ts` (`:22-26, :80-95, :560-575, :772-820, :835-880, :952, :1025`) | Writes the same shape via `anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` / `replacePillSpan` / `resolvePillIds`; reads it through `coalesceRegionsForRuler` (`coalesceForAgent`, `:77-86`) so the model reasons in virtual seconds over whole pills. |

## Known gaps

- `legacyEditor.speedRegions` and `legacyEditor.cameraFullscreenRegions` are migrated
  on every parse via the schema preprocess, but a project whose `legacyEditor` blob
  is rewritten by an older code path before the v5 preprocess runs may briefly carry
  the un-anchored form downstream. The single parse-time entry point keeps the
  surface small but does not make it impossible; the regression is caught by
  `migrate.test.ts`.
