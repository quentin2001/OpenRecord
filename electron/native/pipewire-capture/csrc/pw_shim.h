/*
 * Flat C ABI between the Rust helper and libpipewire.
 *
 * Every declaration here is mirrored by hand in `src/shim.rs`. The two files
 * are a matched pair: changing a struct on one side without the other is an ABI
 * break the compiler cannot catch, so keep the field order and the integer
 * widths identical.
 *
 * Only plain scalars and pointers cross this boundary — no SPA or PipeWire type
 * appears in a signature — so Rust never has to restate a PipeWire struct
 * layout. That is deliberate: the layouts live in the vendored headers and are
 * consumed by the C compiler that also compiled libpipewire's own users.
