//! NDJSON protocol spoken on stdout: one JSON object per line, flushed per
//! line, every object carrying `event` and `schemaVersion`.
//!
//! The vocabulary is the ScreenCaptureKit helper's (`ready` / `warning` /
//! `error`, see electron/native/screencapturekit/…/main.swift) plus what this
//! helper needs on top:
//!
//!   * `stream-started` — the portal dialog is done and PipeWire is streaming.
//!     It is separate from `ready` on purpose. `ready` fires in milliseconds,
//!     before the portal picker is raised; `stream-started` cannot fire until
//!     the user has clicked through a dialog, which has no upper bound. The
//!     Electron session resolves `start()` on `ready` so its readiness timeout
//!     does not have to accommodate a human.
//!   * `cursor-sample` — one cursor observation.
//!   * `encoder-selection` / `capture-started` / `capture-stopped` — Stage 2's
//!     video half. `capture-started` is the Linux spelling of the "Recording
//!     started" line the Windows helper prints, and the parent waits on it
//!     before telling the UI that recording has begun.
//!   * `debug` — the Stage 1 instrumentation, gated on OPENSCREEN_PIPEWIRE_DEBUG.
