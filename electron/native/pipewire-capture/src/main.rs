//! OpenScreen Linux capture helper.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. Two reasons, and they turned out to be the same reason.
//!
//! `screen.getCursorScreenPoint()` returns {0,0} under Wayland, so
//! `TelemetryRecordingSession` produced recordings whose every cursor sample sat
//! in the screen's top-left corner while looking perfectly well-formed. The only
//! source of truth for the pointer on Wayland is the ScreenCast portal's
//! METADATA cursor mode.
//!
//! And in that same mode the compositor keeps the cursor OUT of the captured
//! pixels — which is what the editor needs in order to draw its own. Chromium's
//! `getDisplayMedia` gives the opposite: a frame with the pointer already
//! painted in, and no way to know where it was. One portal session answers both,
//! and it has to be one session because SelectSources may only be called once.
//!
//! SHAPE. A stdio sidecar, like the macOS and Windows helpers: JSON request in
//! argv[1], NDJSON events on stdout, `stop`/`pause`/`resume` (or EOF) on stdin.
//! With `outputPath` it also encodes H.264 and writes an MP4; without it, it is
//! the cursor-only session Stage 1 shipped, which is what
//! `PipeWireCursorRecordingSession` still uses.
//!
//! WHAT IT CANNOT DO. Mouse buttons. Wayland exposes no portal for input
//! events, and /dev/input/event* is root:input. Every sample is therefore a
//! "move"; there is no click detection to be had here at any effort level.
