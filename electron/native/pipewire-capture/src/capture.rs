//! The video half of Stage 2: PipeWire frames in, MP4 on disk out.
//!
//! CONSTANT FRAME RATE, DRIVEN BY A CLOCK, NOT BY ARRIVALS.
//!
//! A compositor delivers frames on damage. Nothing moves on screen, no frames
//! arrive — mutter will happily go seconds without one while the user reads a
//! page. Writing one output frame per delivered frame would therefore produce a
//! file whose playback speed depends on how busy the screen was, which is not a
//! recording of anything.
//!
//! So the output rate comes from a monotonic clock instead. [`Capture::advance`]
//! asks what frame index the wall clock is on and encodes forward to it, holding
//! the last staged picture across the gap. That is why [`crate::encoder`] splits
//! conversion from encoding: a held frame costs an upload and an encode (1.4 ms
//! here) but not the colour conversion (3.6 ms), which is the expensive part.
//!
//! The clock is ours, not the compositor's. `SPA_META_Header.pts` is more precise
//! per frame, but pause/resume and — once Stage 2's audio lands — the audio
//! epoch all live on this process's monotonic clock, and quantising to 1/60 s
//! makes the difference between the two immaterial.
