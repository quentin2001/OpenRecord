 * Turns the Linux helper's NDJSON stdout into `CursorRecordingData`.
 *
 * Extracted from `PipeWireCursorRecordingSession` because there are now two
 * callers and only one helper. The cursor-only session spawns the helper for
 * telemetry alone; the native capture session spawns it for video AND telemetry,
 * from the same portal session. Sharing this class is what keeps them from
 * drifting — and, more importantly, is what lets the second one exist at all:
 * `SelectSources` may be called once per portal session, so two processes would
 * mean two pickers, which is exactly the double-prompt this replaces.
