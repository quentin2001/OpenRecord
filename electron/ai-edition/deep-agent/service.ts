// ponytail: port of axcut's AxcutDeepAgentService (apps/server/src/services/

// `webContents.send`.
//
// It used to wrap `createDeepAgent` from the `deepagents` package. That factory
// stacks three middlewares unconditionally — filesystem, todo-list, sub-agents —
// which handed the model EIGHT extra tools (ls / read_file / write_file /
// edit_file / glob / grep / write_todos / task) bound to an EMPTY in-memory
// backend, plus ~5 800 characters of system prompt promising a filesystem this
// app does not have. Nothing here used any of it, and the cost was not
// cosmetic: asked what cursor telemetry the project holds, the model ran
// `ls {"path":"/"}` then `glob {"pattern":"**/*"}` against that empty sandbox
// and reported, in good faith, that the project contains no pointer data. A
// fabricated proof of absence. `createDeepAgent` has no option to drop those
// middlewares (they are in `REQUIRED_MIDDLEWARE_NAMES`), so the fix is to stop
// going through it: `createAgent` is what it wrapped, minus the sandbox.
