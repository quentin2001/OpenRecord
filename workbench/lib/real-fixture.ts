// ponytail: the one fixture the workbench did not write itself.
//
// `lib/fixtures.ts` builds documents from code. That is the right default —
// minimal, deterministic, every field justified — and it has a ceiling: the
// silences, the pointer paths and the words are all ours. A model that learns
// the shape of our generator scores well without understanding anything, and a
// detector tuned against synthetic dwells is graded by the same hand that wrote
// them.
//
// This module loads a REAL take instead: a 66 s screencast the user recorded,
// transcribed by the local Whisper helper, with its own cursor sidecar. Nothing
// is normalised, rounded or tidied on the way in — the document reaches the
// model in the state it has on disk, `originalPath`, absent `cameraTrack` and
// all. See `workbench/fixtures/README.md` for where it comes from and for the
// single field that was removed from the sidecar (11 base64 pointer bitmaps,
// 112 kB, referenced by id and never decoded).
//
// The ground truth of what the user was DOING lives nowhere near here. It
// belongs to the assertions; a scenario that let it reach the model would be
// grading a dictation.
