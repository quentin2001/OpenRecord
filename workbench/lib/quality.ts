// ponytail: the six questions a human asks about a CUT, as arithmetic.
//
// `editorial.ts` answers "what did this turn do to the material": how much
// speech disappeared, what the delta is per family, whether a zoom is a flash.
// It is deliberately blind to two things, and both are where the judgement
// actually lives:
//
//   • it has no notion of a PAUSE. `silenceSpans` returns the complement of the
//     words INSIDE the transcript's own span, with no minimum duration. On the
//     synthetic fixtures that is the list a human would draw, because those
//     fixtures declare `kind:"silence"` segments with round bounds. On the real
//     66 s take it returns the eight inter-word gaps — six silences, plus a
//     0.22 s and a 0.29 s breath that must not be cut — and it cannot see the
//     2.33 s before the first word AT ALL, which is 23 % of the silence in that
//     recording and the single easiest thing to cut. An oracle built on it
//     under-reports what there was to do and credits cutting a breath.
//   • it has no notion of GROUND TRUTH for zooms beyond `InterestPoint`, which
//     is a single instant with a tolerance. A user showing an image for seven
//     seconds is not an instant, and scoring a zoom by whether it contains a
//     centre point cannot tell a 0.5 s flash on that centre from a zoom that
//     actually covers the moment.
//
// So: pauses first (with a floor and an edge/interior distinction), then the
// four oracles that need them, then placement against declared zones with
// precision AND recall — never one blended score, because the two failures they
// describe have opposite fixes. A model that emits one huge zoom has recall 1
// and precision near 0; a model that emits one perfect 1 s zoom out of six
// zones has precision 1 and recall near 0. A single number calls both "0.5".
//
// Every function here is deterministic and quotes seconds. None of them knows
// what the user was doing — the zones come in as an argument, from the
// assertion side of a scenario, and must never reach the model.
