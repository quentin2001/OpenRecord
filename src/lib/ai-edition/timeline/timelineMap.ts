//                rejoined, …) is irrelevant: identity is what a region IS, never where
//                it came from or how it got there.
//   2. REPEL   — two regions of the same kind with DIFFERENT identities may not
//                overlap. An edit clamps to the neighbour's edge; the neighbour never
//                moves (no cascade).
//
// A kind with no properties (trim, full-camera) collapses to a constant identity, so
// its regions always merge — the long-standing trim behaviour, now *derived* from the
// general rule instead of hand-coded beside it.
