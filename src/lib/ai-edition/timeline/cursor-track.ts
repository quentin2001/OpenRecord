//
// ponytail: this is an OBSERVATION, not an interpretation, and the distinction
// is the whole point of the module. Its predecessor handed the model a list of
// "dwell moments" computed by the same stillness detector that drives the magic
// wand. That reads as helpful and is not: it caps the model at the detector's
// recall. Measured on a real 66s screencast, the detector reports 6 of 6
// annotated interest zones but 8 false positives out of 16 — and it is blind by
// construction to the one zone where the user traced slowly across an image
// while narrating, because the cursor genuinely travelled 30% of the frame. A
// model fed that digest can never zoom there, however good it is. So the wand
// keeps its detector, the model gets the track, and the bench compares them.
//
// Downsampling is resolution, not interpretation: every kept point is a real
// sample, nothing is summarised, and every pointer-shape change survives the
// reduction because a shape change is an observed event, not a verdict about it.
