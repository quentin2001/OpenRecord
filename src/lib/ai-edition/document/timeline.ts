/**
 * Regions after a rebuild, by provenance — the fix for the quietest half of
 * D-DESTRUCT.
 *
 * The old code ran `reanchorRegions` over everything, which re-ventilates each
 * region from its RAW ruler ms. That is right for a region whose clip is gone
 * (its ruler position is all that is left of it) and wrong for one whose clip
 * survived: with the intervals [35-60], [0-25], a zoom anchored to clip_2 at
 * source 40-45 came back anchored at source 50-55. Ten seconds into different
 * footage, schema-valid, unreported. Anything whose anchor still resolves is
 * therefore rederived — the anchor IS the content — and only the orphans are
 * re-ventilated.
 *
 * The orphan branch also has to decide what "re-ventilation found nothing"
 * means, and the answer depends on where the region came from.
 * `anchorRegionsWithDerivedMs` passes such a region through UNCHANGED, which is
 * right for a never-anchored one (a v2 migration keeps a region it cannot place
 * rather than losing user data) and wrong for one whose clip was just deleted:
 * that leaves it pointing at an id nothing resolves, invisible to the timeline
 * and revivable by any future clip that happens to take the name. Its content
 * is gone, so it goes with it — the same call `removeClip` and
 * `setClipSourceRange` already make through `rederiveRegionMs`.
