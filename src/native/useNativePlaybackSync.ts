/**
 * Mirrors the app's transport (play/pause) and playhead (scrub/step) onto the
 * active native compositor view. Mounted once in the editor shell; a no-op
 * whenever no native view is active (flag off / addon absent), so it's safe to
 * call unconditionally.
 *
 * Playback model — why we don't push a seek every frame:
 *  - Play/pause maps to native *free-run* (`setNativePlaying`). While playing,
 *    the native decoder advances its own frames sequentially (cheap).
 *  - `currentTimeSec` ticks every rAF frame during playback. Pushing
 *    `setNativeTime` per tick would force an O(n) rewind+decode seek each frame
 *    AND fight the free-run (the render thread prioritises app-requested frames
 *    over free-run). So discrete seeks are only sent while *paused* — i.e. real
 *    scrub/step interactions. Pausing also re-snaps native to the app playhead.
 *
 * Known POC limitation: during free-run the native clock and the app clock can
 * drift (independent tickers); acceptable for the fixture (~6 s loop). A pause
 * re-aligns them.
